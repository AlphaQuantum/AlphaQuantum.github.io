# AlphaQuantum

## About me
Hi there! My name is `Anass`, but in the programming I would prefer to be called `AlphaQuantum`. I am a programmer with a passion for building websites, learning new things and reading. In my free time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest technology trends, however lately i've been focusing mainly on Javascript and its endless new frameworks :D.

## Technologies Used
For this website, I utilized the following technologies:
+ GitHub Pages: I used GitHub Pages to host my website, which allows me to easily publish static content to the web without the need for additional hosting services.
+ Bootstrap: I used Bootstrap as a front-end framework to give my website a responsive and professional look and feel.
+ JavaScript: I used JavaScript to add interactive features to my website, such as animations on scroll.
>I plan to revamp this website using react and tailwind.

## Last but not least
I am always looking to expand my skillset and try out new technologies, so if you have any recommendations or opportunities for collaboration, I would love to hear from you!
